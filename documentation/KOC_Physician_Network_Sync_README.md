# KOC Physician Network Sync

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Plugin Slug:** `koc-physician-network-sync`  
**Author:** Moxcar Communications  
**Primary Site:** [KOCOrtho.com](https://kocortho.com)  
**Consumer Sites:** [KOSCortho.com](https://koscortho.com), [UOSOrtho.com](https://uosortho.com)

---

## Overview

This plugin synchronizes physician profile data from the **source of truth** at **KOCOrtho.com** to multiple consumer WordPress sites (**KOSCortho** and **UOSOrtho**).  

It enables consistent, secure, and automated updates for all physician information while still allowing limited local edits via a configurable whitelist.

---

## Key Features

- üîÅ **Two-way architecture:** One-way sync from KOC ‚Üí Consumer sites (read-only downstream).  
- üîê **Secure API:** WordPress REST API protected by Application Passwords and IP allowlists.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Automated sync:** Full import + incremental updates on a configurable schedule (default 8 hours).  
- üß† **UUID-based identity:** Every physician post is assigned a globally unique ID for consistent mapping across sites.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Field-level control:** Admin whitelist for fields allowed to remain locally editable.  
- üßæ **Detailed logging:** Sync activity and errors stored locally for review.  
- üö´ **No media syncing:** All images and links remain pointed at KOCOrtho (headshots remain manual).  

---

## Plugin Architecture

### 1. Source Site (KOCOrtho.com)

**Responsibilities:**
- Hosts the canonical physician database.  
- Exposes REST API endpoints for full and incremental sync.  
- Maintains UUIDs for all physician posts.  
- Uses Application Passwords and IP allowlists for secure access.  

**API Endpoints:**
```

GET /wp-json/koc-sync/v1/physicians?updated_since=ISO8601&page&per_page
GET /wp-json/koc-sync/v1/physicians/{uuid}

````

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "data": [
    {
      "uuid": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
      "post_type": "physician",
      "slug": "john-doe",
      "post_title": "Dr. John Doe",
      "post_content": "<p>Full HTML content...</p>",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-28T15:03:00Z",
      "acf": {
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "title": "MD",
        "specialty": ["Sports Medicine", "Shoulder"],
        "...": "..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "total": 92,
    "next": "https://kocortho.com/wp-json/koc-sync/v1/physicians?page=2"
  }
}
````

### 2. Consumer Sites (KOSCortho / UOSOrtho)

**Responsibilities:**

* Pull updates from KOCOrtho.
* Write synced data to the existing `physician` custom post type.
* Retain whitelist-controlled local fields.
* Manage cron-based and manual syncs.

**Storage:**

* `_koc_global_uuid` (string)
* `_koc_source_updated_at` (ISO8601)
* `_koc_last_synced_at` (ISO8601)

**Sync Flow:**

1. **Full Import:** Fetch all physicians ‚Üí match by UUID ‚Üí fallback to slug+full name+post_type ‚Üí log unmatched.
2. **Incremental Sync:** Fetch by `updated_since` every 8 hours.
3. **Conflict Handling:** KOC wins for all non-whitelisted fields.
4. **Deletions:** Downstream posts are unpublished or marked inactive when removed upstream.

---

Would you like me to add a **developer section** (detailing class structure, filters, and extensibility hooks for future developers)? That would make the README suitable for internal handoff or version control.
